3D Endless Runner Game with Streamlit and Three.js
This project demonstrates how to embed a 3D game created with Three.js into a Python Streamlit application. This allows for easy deployment of web-based games on Streamlit Cloud.

Project Structure
You should have the following files in your project directory:

app.py: The main Streamlit application script that embeds the game.

game.html: The self-contained HTML file with all the game logic using Three.js.

requirements.txt: A file listing the Python dependencies (only streamlit is needed).

README.md: This instruction file.

1. Running Locally
Follow these steps to run the game on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or newer installed on your system.

pip (Python's package installer).

Steps
1. Create requirements.txt:

Create a new file named requirements.txt in your project folder and add the following line to it:

streamlit

2. Install Dependencies:

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit App:

In the same terminal, run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser should automatically open with the game running!

2. Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
Deploying your game is straightforward with Streamlit Cloud.

Prerequisites
A GitHub account.

Your project pushed to a GitHub repository.

Steps
1. Push to GitHub:

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Upload the app.py, game.html, and requirements.txt files to this repository.

2. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:

Go to share.streamlit.io and sign in.

Click the "New app" button.

Choose the GitHub repository you just created.

Ensure the branch is set correctly (usually main or master).

The "Main file path" should be app.py.

Click the "Deploy!" button.

Streamlit will handle the rest! In a few moments, your 3D game will be live and shareable with a public URL.
